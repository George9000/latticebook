# Explore Figures in LMDVR using Julia Makie 

This repo explores using Makie for visualizations and datasets in the book, "[Lattice: Multivariate Data Visualization with R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-75969-2)" by Deepayan Sarkar.
The [associated site](https://lmdvr.r-forge.r-project.org/figures/figures.html) has R code and figures.

It uses the RDatasets and RCall packages.

To use it make a directory, `figures`, inside the cloned package. All figures will be saved there and will not be tracked.

Adjust fonts in `src/latticebook.jl` to those found in the system used.
